      <h3>Download our Job Posting Template</h3>
      <p>Create a job posting that sells! After reviewing thousands of remote job listings, we here at We Work Remotely
        created a free template for you to use.</p>
      <h3>Tips on creating a successful job posting</h3>
      <p> How to transform your job description into a job posting that sells.</p>
      <h4>1. Use an accurate and searchable job title</h4>
      <p>Using a title like ‚ÄúDesign Unicorn‚Äù may be funny and appealing to some, but your job posting will be left out
        of search results and you‚Äôll miss out on qualified applicants.</p>
      <p>Job seekers are looking up common keywords and phrases like ‚Äúcontent writer,‚Äù ‚ÄúUX designer,‚Äù and ‚Äúcustomer
        support specialist.‚Äù</p>
      <h4>2. Include an emotive introduction</h4>
      <p>It‚Äôs just like writing a blog post or sales copy. What‚Äôs your hook? Captivate the candidates you‚Äôre looking for
        by including 3-5 details that they‚Äôll find exciting. What makes the role exciting? Why should they apply to work
        with and for you?</p>
      <h4>3. Describe the ideal candidate you‚Äôre looking for</h4>
      <p>First list out the characteristics and soft skills you‚Äôd want in an ideal candidate. This allows applicants to
        see you‚Äôre wanting to hire an actual human being, not just a robot that checks the boxes for qualifications and
        requirements.</p>
      <h4>4. Tell your company story</h4>
      <p>Who is your company? In a brief paragraph of 3-4 sentences, describe what problem your company solves, how long
        you‚Äôve been around, the company culture, and the stability of your company. Don‚Äôt forget to include those
        company values! :)</p>
      <h4>5. Describe your remote situation</h4>
      <p> Candidates flag us everyday reporting job listings that aren‚Äôt really remote. In most cases, the company
        actually does meet the remote requirements but fails to explicitly state their remote situation or what kind of
        remote company they are.</p>
      <h4>6. Provide a clear outline of the responsibilities of the position</h4>
      <p>Now that you‚Äôve completely captivated the candidate with compelling information, provide the requirements that
        are essential to this job. What will their day-to-day look like? Who will they work with? Who will they report
        to?</p>
      <h4>7. Provide a list of requirements</h4>
      <p> Here‚Äôs where you list out what you require this candidate to be. Aside from previous experience and education,
        are they required to be a problem-solver? Collaborator? A keen eye for a certain aesthetic?</p>
      <h4>8. Include company benefits</h4>
      <p>If you‚Äôre a young company, and you don‚Äôt have benefits to sell with quite yet, state that! Honesty and being
        upfront is really what it‚Äôs about.</p>
      <h4> 9. Break down the application process</h4>
      <p> In steps, provide what the process is from when they first apply to when they get hired. This‚Äôll inform the
        candidates and they won‚Äôt need to contact you wondering, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs next?‚Äù</p>
      <h3>Reasons why your job posting isn‚Äôt getting traction</h3>
      <p> On rare occasions, companies have reached out to us wondering why their job listing is receiving a lower than
        expected amount of applications. Below are common reasons why:</p>
      <h4>The job role isn‚Äôt clear</h4>
      <p>The job description hasn‚Äôt been fully thought out and they‚Äôre basically looking for a unicorn. For example,
        combining marketing and web development. ü§î Seriously.</p>
      <h4>The job posting looks like a bit of a disaster</h4>
      <p> The job listing either has too much or too little copy. The formatting is off. The tone of the job listing is
        trying a bit too hard to sell themselves or feels inauthentic.</p>
      <h4>The job posting is lacklustre</h4>
      <p>Speaking of tone, a common reason a job listing may not be getting any traction is that it‚Äôs either missing the
        company‚Äôs brand voice or all of the sweet reasons why they‚Äôre a great place to work at. We‚Äôre not just talkin‚Äô
        benefits and perks, we also mean, what are your company‚Äôs values? More and more, job seekers are searching for
        companies that align with the way they work and think. It‚Äôs a win-win situation, really. Wouldn‚Äôt you want
        employees who support your vision, after all? Including this information also helps filter out candidates who
        may not align with your mission or values.</p>
      <h4>The job posting is mistaken for a job description</h4>
      <p>A job posting is not the same thing as a job description. Job descriptions communicate the responsibilities and
        expectations of the role that a company uses internally. Job postings sell the position, your company, team,
        remote-ness, and why you‚Äôre awesome. A job posting is what should be posted on job boards, like ours! As you
        guessed it, write your job description first before the job posting.</p>
